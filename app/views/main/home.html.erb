    This is a demo website developed by Mike Zhou (youz@ualberta.ca) in response to the first question
    of the coding chanllenge of Req#92534 ISL 27R â€“ Full Stack Developer. Please read this article before
    evaluate the website.
  </p>
  <h5>How to use this website</h5>
  <p>The website address the Five user stories of the question:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>As a user, I want to navigate a web-based application, so that I can find events of interest.</strong></li>
    <p>In table 1, you can navigate all events. The events are dynamically pulled from the remote database as you browse them. The table only shows a few attributes due to space, you can see the details of an event by clicking on the round button on the left end of every row.</p>

    <li><strong>As a user, I want to save the data retrieved from the REST APIs to a database for the further process.</strong></li>
    <p>In table 1, click on the Save button on the right end of every data row to save the data. You need to sign in to test this feature.</p>

    <li><strong>As a user, I want to filter out events by Area, Severity, Event Type and Start Date.</strong></li>
    <p>In table 1 above the actual table, there are Four filters for the related fields. Select a value to automatically refresh table 1.</p>

    <li><strong>As a user, I want to provide two REST API endpoints to give data access to other applications. The REST API endpoints include creating new events and getting highest severity events by Areas.</strong></li>
    <p>I don't quite understand the first API. The API doc does not say how to save an event to the remote database, and I doubt that is possible for a random person. So I assume you want me to save the event to a local event table not related to the remote database.</p>

    <li><strong>As a user, I want to monitor API usage data based on the API calls from other applications.</strong></li>
    <p>In table 3, you can see the usage data. It refreshes every 5 seconds.</p>
  </ol>

  <h5>Known issues</h5>
  <p>There are a number of known issues when I implemented the site.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the first table the <strong>Next</strong> button never works and the pagination will continue to show more pages than the last page until the last page is actually visited.</li>
    <p>This is because the events API does not return total number of events. The API also seems to be buggy as the <strong>next_url</strong> part of the <strong>pagination</strong> section is never found. So there is no way to know if the next page exists until after we read all the data. Not to mention that the <a href="http://open511.org/documentation.html" target="_blank">Official Open511 Documentation</a> is also broken at the time I worked on the assessment. So I have no idea how to use the API other than learning from the examples in the main pages.</p>
    <li>Headline and Event Type seem to be identical</li>
    <p>This is not a bug from my end, the data in the API have the identical values for both fields. Not sure if they are intented to be the same.</p>
  </ul>

    <h5>Table 1: Main events table</h5>
    <p>This table directly queries the remote API. It allows the user to browser all events current available in the remote database. You can use the dropboxes below to select different options to filter the results. Results are filtered automatically when a new options is selected. You can save events by clicking on the <i>Save</i> button on the right end of the row. Saved events will appear in the second table. You must log in first in order to use the save function. Click on the left end button to see more details of the target event.</p>
